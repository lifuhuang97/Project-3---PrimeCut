<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project serves to help health-conscious people keep track of their daily caloric and macronutrient intake. When I was (still am) trying to lose weight, my research showed me that weight loss is close to impossible if you aren't aware of how much you are eating. This proved to be true as after I began tracking my calories intake, I found a correlation between the number of calories that I ate and the rate at which I was losing weight.

However, calories tracking and food tracking was a pain as I frequently ate different things and have to re-calculate my calories after every meal. I used a Google Spreadsheet to help me but it became crowded and really difficult to manage. This hence gave me the idea of creating a web application to help me do that, hence PrimeCut.

PrimeCut also serves to help gym enthusiasts and people following specific diets track their macronutrients intake, however it is optional to input those fields (for example for me, who wants to use the app primarily to track calories).

User login authentication using Firebase and user data is stored in Firestore
